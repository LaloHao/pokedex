** Running on android:
  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
    react-native run-android
  #+END_SRC
  
** Running on iOS 
  Running on iOS requires OSX with XCode build tools, you can either run it from
  XCode on a real device by connecting and pairing, or locally on a simulator
  from the cli:
  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
    react-native run-ios
  #+END_SRC
  
** Lint and typechecking
   Project uses flow types and semi-custom eslint config, you can check them
   both by running respectively:

  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
    npm run flow
  #+END_SRC
  
  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
    npm run lint
  #+END_SRC
   
** Folder structure
*** Assets
    Color pallete and images should be located in the =assets= directory:
    #+BEGIN_SRC bash
    assets
    |-- Colors.js
    |-- Images
    |   |-- index.js
    |   `-- logo-pokemon.png
    `-- index.js
    #+END_SRC
 
*** Source code
    Root =index.js= (outside =src= directory) implements offline data with redux
    persist and loads router.

    Router is implemented in =App.js=, each route is a =screen= (container) and
    they are stored in =screens= folders.

    =Screens= load bare =components= from their own directory.

    =Screens= load their data from the redux =store=, the data is fetched using
    =rxjs= (observables) AKA =epics=.
